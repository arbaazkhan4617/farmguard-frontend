# 🌱 FarmGuard - AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection

**A revolutionary web application that helps farmers detect plant diseases early using artificial intelligence, contributing to global food security and sustainable agriculture.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Global Food Security Crisis**: Plant diseases cause up to 40% of global crop losses annually, threatening food security for millions of people worldwide. Small-scale farmers, who produce 80% of the world's food, often lack access to expert agronomists and modern diagnostic tools.

**The Challenge**: Traditional disease detection methods are:
- Time-consuming and require expert knowledge
- Often too late to prevent significant crop damage
- Expensive and inaccessible to small farmers
- Limited by geographical and language barriers
